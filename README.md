# Configure Craft Environment

This is a one-off script that you can use to configure a Craft site (created by [create-craft-site](https://github.com/gentsagency/create-craft-site)) on your local machine.

It configures Homestead and provisions Vagrant so you're good to go in seconds.

## Usage

```sh
npx @gentsagency/configure-craft-env --security-key={{ SECURITY_KEY }}
```

If you don't set a security key, a new one will be generated by running `$ craft setup/security-key`

There are some other options:

```
  --domain
    Local domain that the app will be hosted on
    @default {{ project }}.local

  --homestead-path
    Path to homestead (folder that Homestead.yaml lives in)
    @default ~/homestead/Homestead

  --ssl-path
    Path where the .crt should be stored
    @default ~/.homesteadssl
```
