# Configure Craft Environment

This is a one-off script that you can use to configure a Craft site (created by [create-craft-site](https://github.com/gentsagency/create-craft-site)) on your local machine.

It configures Homestead and provisions Vagrant so you're good to go in seconds.

## Usage

```sh
npx @gentsagency/configure-craft-env --security-key={{ SECURITY_KEY }}
```

If you don't set a security key, a new one will be generated by running `$ craft setup/security-key`
